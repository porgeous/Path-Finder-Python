# Path Finder

This is a terminal based "path finder" program that calculates and displays the shortest path between the start and end points in the "maze."  It uses curses to create the terminal characters and the entire code is programmed in Python.  Yet another coding experience that felt more enjoyable and accessible due to the Python syntax being easier to read compared to JS.  Credit goes to Tech with Tim for the project template.
